Fifth-order dispersive equations arise in the context of higher-order models for phenomena such as water waves. For fifth-order variable-coefficient linear dispersive equations, we provide conditions under which the intitial value problem is either well-posed or ill-posed. For well-posedness, a balance must be struck between the leading-order dispersion and possible backwards diffusion from the fourth-derivative term. This generalizes work by the first author and Wright for third-order equations. In addition to inherent interest in fifth-order dispersive equations, this work is also motivated by a question from numerical analysis: finite difference schemes for third-order numerical equations can yield approximate solutions which effectively satisfy fifth-order equations. We find that such a fifth-order equation is well-posed if and only if the underlying third-order equation is ill-posed.
