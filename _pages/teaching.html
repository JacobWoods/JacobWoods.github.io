  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    My teaching philosophy centers on connecting abstract theoretical concepts to
    real-world ecological and computational systems. I believe that students learn best
    when they can actively model, simulate, and experiment—linking mathematical
    reasoning to tangible outcomes in the field or lab.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across the courses I teach, I emphasize collaboration, iterative problem-solving,
    and the creative process behind research. I aim to help students build confidence
    in quantitative reasoning and see themselves as participants in discovery.
