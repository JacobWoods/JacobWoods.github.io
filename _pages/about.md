I earned my undergraduate and master's degrees in Mathematics from Drexel University. My research interests are primarily in the field of applied mathematics. I am especially interested in questions related to biology and ecology. I specifically study mathematical models for the collective movement of populations, working with models that describe populations from the agent level to macroscopic densities, incorporating data from the field to calibrate parameters of principled models.  When I am not spending my time working on research or teaching, I spend time traveling around rock climbing destinations, a hobby I have had and an industry I have spent time instructing in for more than 15 years.
