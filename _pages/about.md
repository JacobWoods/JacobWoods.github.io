I earned my undergraduate and master's degrees in Mathematics from Drexel University. My research interests are primarily in the field of applied mathematics. I am especially interested in questions related to biology and ecology. I specifically study mathematical models for the collective movement of populations, working with models that describe populations from the agent level to macroscopic densities, incorporating data from the field to calibrate parameters of principled models.  When I am not spending my time working on research or teaching, I spend time traveling around rock climbing destinations, a hobby I have had and an industry I have spent time instructing in for more than 15 years.

Past Work
======
During my undergraduate degree I worked on exploring the dynamics of networks looking at Kuramoto with additive noise using the Euler-Maruyama time stepping scheme to simulate it numerically under the guidance of Gideon Simpson and Georgi Medvedev. This experience can be read about more [here](https://www.math.drexel.edu/~medvedev/reu/reu2019/).  

I also spent a 6-month Co-op at Drexel University, where I worked under the guidance of David Ambrose, studying the well-posedness and ill-posedness of 5th order linear equations, resulting in a [paper](https://jacobwoods.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3).  

Personal Projects and Activities
======

From a young age, I became an avid rock climber, spending time traveling rural America and abroad competing at a national and international level as well as climbing outside.  Through these experiences, I gained a lot of perspective and had the opportunity to coach and mentor many young athletes teaching important technical skills required for the sport.  I have since still played a role in the community, helping organize fundraising events and graffiti clean-up efforts with the former organization Haycock Bouldering Coalition, whose duties have been absorbed by [EPAC](https://epaclimbers.org/portfolio/haycock-mountain/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
