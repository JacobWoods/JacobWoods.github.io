 Taught sections of Calculus I in Spring 2022 and Summer 2022/2025.


Course Materials
======
Our course textbook is James Stewart's Calculus, Early Transcendentals, 8th Edition. Many of the homework problems for the course are available on WebAssign, which requires a new edition of the text or a separately purchased code. For that reason, we advise that you do not buy a used version of the text. The text is available here: https://www.cengage.com/coursepages/Temple_Calculus There are also videos for this course here: https://math.temple.edu/ugrad/learning_tools/videos1041/.

Topics Covered
======
The three central objects of the semester are limits, derivatives, and integrals. In studying these objects, we will see the connections between them, how to compute different types of them, and how to apply such calculations to some practical problems.
