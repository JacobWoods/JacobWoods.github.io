Ran a lab for undergraduates to review course material and implement numerical methods in MATLAB with the supervision of an instructor.

Course Materials
======

Our course textbook is James Stewart's Calculus, Early Transcendentals, 8th Edition. Many of the homework problems for the course are available on WebAssign. 

Topics Covered
======
The three central objects of the semester are limits, derivatives, and integrals. In studying these objects, we will see the connections between them, how to compute different types of them, and how to apply such calculations to some practical problems.
