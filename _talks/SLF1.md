In 2014 the spotted lanternfly was introduced to Pennsylvania and with its ability to severely compromise lumber, grape and crop production has become a species of great concern. We present principled models for the spread of the species, capturing their hopping behavior across hosts, as observed and documented in the field. A calibrated model prototype is showcased with vineyards in mind, capturing how spotted lanternflies move between hosts in landscapes with different host geometries over the course of a season. We demonstrate how different geometries of hosts like those found in vineyards, deep forest, or edge ecosystems produce different emergent patterns of spread. We also connect the small-scale hopping model to large-scale models which forecast the spread over areas the size of the entire Northeastern US or of California.
