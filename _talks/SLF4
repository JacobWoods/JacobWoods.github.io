The Spotted Lanternfly, an invasive species currently present in the Northeastern United States, causes significant environmental and economic damage. Understanding the spread of the species is important at multiple scales. For instance, stakeholders at local scales care about the annual re-invasion of crop fields. In contrast, state and national stakeholders are concerned with the invasion of new areas over years and hundreds of kilometers. For the plant-hopping Spotted Lanternfly, the local arrangement of hosts is a primary driver of movement. We present how macroscopic movement models for a population can be systematically derived from a principled model for the movement of individual agents in periodic domains. In particular, we demonstrate how certain host geometries can lead to the emergence of asymmetric spread patterns even if the agent behavior exhibits no directional bias.
