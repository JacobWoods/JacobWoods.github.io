Multi-agent systems in multiple dimensions occur in many contexts like human traffic, flocks of
birds, and schools of fish. These systems can produce complex emergent phenomena which are not
immediately apparent from the individual agents’ law of motion and objectives. In many cases, the
emergent behaviors are beneficial like: protection from predators, greater social interactions, and
more efficient movement in the environment. One-dimensional traffic flow also exhibits emergent
structures; but these are frequently undesirable, like phantom jams and traffic waves. In this talk we
present ideas for models that draw from both traffic models and swarming models to produce new
models for multi-agent dynamics in 2D and 3D that exhibit agent-following behavior like cars and
thus can develop dynamic instabilities. These models may describe swarming with leader effects and
driving in the absence of roadways, more accurately than classical swarming models. We showcase
via simulations and some analytical results, how the new models can produce very different
emergent swarm behavior than existing swarming models.
